# BraDyCMS docs


This is the documentation section of **BraDyCMS** that we are trying to improve ceaselessly.
Some sections need to be updated, other need to be written, other need some heavy revision.

For this reason any **help** in improving and maintaining this documentation will be **much appreciated**.
The documentation is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format, which is 
an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
Check the basics of the Markdown syntax here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics and
the full syntax documentation here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
