# Site configuration

The main settings of your BraDyCMS site can be set and changed using the
[configuration editor module](#cfg/edit). Some of the options can be edited by
all users, other require administrator rights to be accessed.

Before making any change in the main configuration module be sure to read and fully
understand these documentation.

**A misconfiguration of the site can prevent it from
working at all.**

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.+)$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.\*)$ http://%1/$1 [R=301,L]

#### Additional .htaccess directives
Here can be entered some additional, customized,  .htaccess directives that will
be automatically appended at the end of the .htaccess file after each system update.

in the .htaccess file.

in different languages (besides the system language, see above).
