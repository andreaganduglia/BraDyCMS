# Template system documentation

This section of the documentation is entirely dedicated to the BraDyCMS templating system.

We love to call BraDyCMS a design-oriented CMS, which means that the templating system is
probably one on the most interesting parts of our CMS. You will learn here how to build
awesome customized templates.

If you are familiar **HTML** and **CSS** you should be able to create beautiful basic templates 
for BraDyCMS in an hour.

If you are familiar to [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html), you know what
[Less](http://lesscss.org/) is, you have some basics of Javascript and you love [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
well... This is the right CMS for you!

Read the docs and [report any issue](https://github.com/jbogdani/BraDyCMS/issues) you might have!
